Method 1
    1. Sign in to a privileged or administrator account, open the Command Prompt (cmd), 
    and run the vssadmin list providers command to see what VSS providers are on your 
    computer.

        a. If there are VSS providers besides Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider and 
        Microsoft File Share Shadow Copy Provider, remove them before retrying the backup.
    
        b. If there are no other VSS providers except Microsoft Software Shadow Copy 
        Provider and Microsoft File Share Shadow Copy Provider, but you still run into 
        the same error code, this might be due to compatibility issues. If you have 
        installed any of the following software, remove it or contact your service 
        provider for assistance before retrying the backup:

            1. Reboot Restore Rx
            2. TuneUp Utilities 2009/2010/2011
            3. Kaspersky Removal Tools

Method 2
    1. Sign in to a privileged or administrator account, open the Command Prompt (cmd), 
    and run the vssadmin list writers command to check the status of the VSS writers.
    2. Make sure the status of VSS writers is Stable. If any of their statuses is not 
    Stable, go to Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools > Services. Right click on the service and select Restart.

Method 4
    If the problem still persists after trying all the methods above, it is 
    possible that the system reserved partition is running out of space. So, 
    you need to delete some files from the partition to clear up space for the 
    backup.

        1. Press Windows + R, enter diskmgmt.msc, and click OK.
        2. Right-click on the system reserved partition. The system reserved 
        partition does not usually have a drive letter, so you need to mount 
        it to browse its files. Select Change Drive Letter and Paths...to 
        assign a letter to the system reserved partition.
        3. Open File Explorer and browse the files on the system drive. 
        Delete some files to make room for the backup. To view hidden files 
        and folders:
            a. Click File > Change folder and search options.
            b. On the View tab, select Show hidden files, folders, and drives from the Advanced settings list. Click OK to save the settings.11.png
        4. Open diskmgmt.msc and remove the drive letter assigned to the system reserved volume.
        5. Back up your device again.

Method 5
    Run a command to check and fix the volume:

        1. Open the Command Prompt (cmd).
        2. Enter the following command to check and fix the volume. Replace "X" with the letter of the volume where the system was unable to take snapshots:
            chkdsk /F /R X:
        3. If you see the following message, enter "Y" to check again the next time the device powers on:
        4. Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)

<#
Method 6
Check if the snapshot-taking function on Windows works properly. If errors occur during the process, your Windows device might not be able to take snapshots. Contact Microsoft Support for further assistance.

For Windows 10, 8, and 7

Press Windows key + R.
    Enter systempropertiesprotection and click OK.

On the System Protection tab, click Create and see check whether snapshots can be taken.
